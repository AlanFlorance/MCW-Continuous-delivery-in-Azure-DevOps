# Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps hands-on lab step-by-step

## Abstract and learning objectives 

In this hands-on lab, you will learn how to implement a solution with a combination of Azure Resource Manager templates and Azure DevOps to enable continuous delivery with several Azure PaaS services.

At the end of this workshop, you will be better able to implement solutions for continuous delivery with Azure DevOps in Azure, as well create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template to provision Azure resources, create an Azure DevOps project with a Git repository, and configure continuous delivery with Azure DevOps.

## Overview

Tailspin Toys has asked you to automate their development process in two specific ways. First, they want you to define an Azure Resource Manager template that can deploy their application into the Microsoft Azure cloud using Platform-as-a-Service technology for their web application and their PostgreSQL database. Second, they want you to implement a continuous delivery process that will connect their source code repository into the cloud, automatically run their code changes through unit tests, and then automatically create new software builds and deploy them onto environment-specific deployment slots so that each branch of code can be tested and accessed independently.

## Solution architecture

![Image that shows the pipeline for checking in code to Azure DevOps that goes through automated build and testing with release management to production.](images/stepbystep/media/image2.png "Solution architecture")

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

  >**Note**: This entire lab can be completed using only the Azure Portal.

## Exercise 1: Create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template that can provision the web application, PostgreSQL database, and deployment slots in a single automated process

Duration: 45 Minutes

Tailspin Toys has requested three Azure environments (dev, test, production), each consisting of the following resources:

-   App Service

    -   Web App

    -   Deployment slots (for zero-downtime deployments)

-   PostgreSQL Server

    -   PostgreSQL Database

Since this solution is based on Azure Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) technology, it should take advantage of that platform by utilizing automatic scale for the web app and the PostgreSQL Database PaaS service instead of running virtual machines.

### Task 1: Create an Azure Resource Manager (ARM) template using Azure Cloud Shell

1.  From within the **Azure Cloud Shell** locate the folder where you previously unzipped the Student Files. Open **Code** to this folder with the command below. It should also contain two sub-folders: **armtemplate** and **tailspintoysweb**.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

    ![In the Code window, the Explorer window is displayed and it shows the student files folder that contains two sub-folders.](images/stepbystep/media/image22.png "Code Explorer")
  
2.  In the Code Explorer window, select the **armtemplate** sub-folder and open the **azuredeploy.json** file by selecting it.

    ![In the Code Explorer window, azuredeploy.json is highlighted under the armtemplate folder and the file is opened in the Editor window.](images/stepbystep/media/image23.png "Selecting the azuredeploy.json file")

3.  In the open editor window for the **azuredeploy.json**, scroll through the contents of the Azure Resource Manager Template. This template contains all the necessary code to deploy a Web App and a PostgreSQL database to Azure.

    >**Note**: If you would like to use this template in a future deployment of your own, it can be found in the [Azure Quickstart Templates repository on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates). This specific file can be found [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/master/101-webapp-managed-postgresql/azuredeploy.json).

### Task 2: Configure the list of release environments parameters

1.  Next, you need to configure a list of release environments we'll be deploying to. Our scenario calls for adding three environments: dev, test, and production. This is going to require the addition of some manual code. At the top of the **azuredeploy.json** file, locate the following line of code (on or around line 4).
    ```json
    "parameters": {
    ```  

2.  Insert the following code immediately below that line of code.

    ```json
    "environment": {
        "type": "string",
        "metadata": {
            "description": "Name of environment"
        },
        "allowedValues": [
          "dev",
          "test",
          "production"
        ]
    },
    ```

    After adding the code, it will look like this:

    ![This is a screenshot of the code pasted inside the of the "parameters" object.](images/stepbystep/media/image24.png "Pasted block of JSON code")

    Save the file.

    >**Note**: The **environment** parameter will be used to generate environment specific names for our web app.

### Task 3: Add a deployment slot for the "staging" version of the site

1.  Next, you need to add the "staging" deployment slot to the web app. This is used during a deployment to stage the new version of the web app. This is going to require the addition of some manual code. In the **azuredeploy.json** file, add the following code to the "resources" array, just above the element for the "connectionstrings" (on or around line 156).

    ```json
    {
        "apiVersion": "2016-08-01",
        "name": "staging",
        "type": "slots",
        "tags": {
            "displayName": "Deployment Slot: staging"
        },
        "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
        "dependsOn": [
            "[resourceId('Microsoft.Web/Sites/', variables('webAppName'))]"
        ],
        "properties": {
        },
        "resources": []
    },
    ```

    After adding the code, it will look like this:

    Save the file.

    ![This is a screenshot of the code pasted just below the element for the application insights extension in the "resources" array.](images/stepbystep/media/image39.png "Pasted block of JSON code")

    The complete ARM template should look like the following:

    ```json
    {
        "$schema": "https://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
        "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",

                "allowedValues": [
                    "dev",
                    "test",
                    "production"
                ]
            },

            }
        ]
    }    
    ```

### Task 4: Create the dev environment and deploy the template to Azure

Now that the template file has been uploaded, we'll deploy it several times to create each of our desired environments: *dev*, *test*, and *production*. Let's start with the **dev** environment.

1.  In the **Azure Cloud Shell** terminal, from the same folder that your ARM template resides in, enter the following command and press **Enter**:

    ```bash
    echo "Enter the Resource Group name:" &&
    read resourceGroupName &&
    echo "Enter the location (i.e. westus, centralus, eastus):" &&
    read location &&
    az group create --name $resourceGroupName --location "$location" &&
    az group deployment create --resource-group $resourceGroupName --template-file "$HOME/studentfiles/armtemplate/azuredeploy.json"
    ```
    
    >**Note**: This command is designed to prompt us to enter the resource group name and Azure region (location) we want to deploy our resources to. The script then takes our inputs and passes them as parameters to the Azure CLI command that calls our recently uploaded template file.

    >**Note**: If you've extracted the student files in a different directory than the one indicated in 'Before the hands-on lab' Task 2.2, you will get an error similar to *'[Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/home/username/studentfiles/armtemplate/azuredeploy.json'*. In this case, you should replace $HOME/studentfiles/armtemplate with the path of the directory you chose.

    ![In the Azure Cloud Shell window, the command has been entered is we are prompted for the name of the resource group we want to deploy to.](images/stepbystep/media/image44.png "Azure Cloud Shell window")

2.  Enter the name of a resource group you want to deploy the resources to (i.e. TailSpinToysRG). If it does not already exist, the template will create it. Then, press **Enter**.

3.  Next, we're prompted to enter an Azure region (location) where we want to deploy our resources to (i.e. westus, centralus, eastus). 
    
    Enter the name of an Azure region and then press **Enter**.
   
4.  Next, we're asked to enter a choice for environments we want to deploy to. The template will use our choice to concatenate the name of the environment with the name of the resource during provisioning. 
    
    For this first run, select the *dev* environment by entering **1** and then pressing **Enter**.
    
    ![In the Azure Cloud Shell window, we are prompted for the environment we want to deploy to.](images/stepbystep/media/image46.png "Azure Cloud Shell") 

5.  Next, we're asked to supply an administrator login (username) for the PostgreSQL server and database. This will be the username credential you would need to enter to connect to your newly created database. 
    
    Enter a value for the *administratorLogin* (e.g. **azureuser**) and then press **Enter**.

    ![In the Azure Cloud Shell window, we are prompted for the administrative username for the PostgreSQL server and database we want to create.](images/stepbystep/media/image47.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

6.  Next, we're asked to supply an administrator password for the PostgreSQL server and database. This will be the password credential you would need to enter to connect to your newly created database.

    >**Note**: The password must meet complexity requirements of 8 or more characters, must contain upper and lower case characters, must contain at least one number and at least one special character, e.g. "Database2020!"

    Enter a value for the *administratorLoginPassword* and then press **Enter**.

7. This will kick off the provisioning process which takes a few minutes to create all the resources for the environment. This is indicated by the "Running" text displayed at the bottom of the Azure Cloud Shell while the command is executing.

    ![The Azure Cloud Shell is executing the template based on the parameters we provided.](images/stepbystep/media/image49.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

8. After the template has completed, JSON is output to the Azure Cloud Shell window with a *Succeeded* message.

    ![The Azure Cloud Shell has succeeded in executing the template based on the parameters we provided.](images/stepbystep/media/image50.png "Azure Cloud Shell")

    >**Note**: The above steps were used to provision the *dev* environment. Most of these same steps will be repeated for the *test* and *production* environments below.

### Task 5: Create the test environment and deploy the template to Azure

The following steps are very similar to what was done in the previous task with the exception that you are now creating the **test** environment. Repeat the above steps and select to create the **2. test** environment. You can use the same values as used in the dev environment.

### Task 6: Create the production environment and deploy the template to Azure

The following steps are very similar to what was done in the previous task with the exception that you are now creating the **production** environment. Repeat the above steps and select to create the **3. production** environment. You can use the same values as used in the dev environment.

### Task 7: Review the resource groups

1. In the Azure Portal, navigate to the resource group where all of the resources have been deployed. It should look similar to the screenshot below.

    >**Note**: The specific names of the resources will be slightly different than what you see in the screenshot based on the unique identities assigned.

    ![The Azure Portal is showing all the deployed resources for the resource group we have been using.](images/stepbystep/media/image998.png "998 REPLACE!")

## Exercise 2: Create Azure DevOps project and Git Repository

Duration: 15 Minutes

In this exercise, you will create and configure an Azure DevOps account along with an Agile project.

### Task 1: Create Azure DevOps Account

1. Browse to the Azure DevOps site at <https://dev.azure.com>.

2. If you do not already have an account, select the **Start free** button.
    
    ![In this screenshot, a Start free button is shown on the Azure DevOps home page.](images/stepbystep/media/image56.png "Azure DevOps screenshot")

3. Authenticate with a Microsoft account.

4. Choose **Continue** to accept the Terms of Service, Privacy Statement, and Code of Conduct.

5. Choose a name for new your project. For the purposes of this scenario, we will use *TailspinToys*. Choose **Private** in the Visibility section so that our project is only visible to those who we specifically grant access. Then, select **+ Create project**.
    
    ![In the Create a project to get started window, TailspinToys is highlighted in the Project name box, Private is highlighted in the Visibility box, and Create project is highlighted at the bottom.](images/stepbystep/media/image57.png "Create a project window")

6. Once the Project is created, choose the **Repos** menu option in the left-hand navigation.

    ![In the TailspinToys project window, Repos is highlighted in the left-hand navigation.](images/stepbystep/media/image58.png "TailspinToys navigation window")

7. On the *Repos* page for the **TailspinToys** repository and locate the "Push an existing repository from command line" section. Choose the **Copy push commands to clipboard** button to copy the contents of the panel. We're going to use these commands in an upcoming step.

    ![In the "Add some code!" window, URLs appear to clone to your computer or push an existing repository from command line.](images/stepbystep/media/image59.png "TailspinToys is empty. Add some code! window")

### Task 2: Add the Tailspin Toys source code repository to Azure DevOps

In this Task, you will configure the Azure DevOps Git repository. You will configure the remote repository using Git and then push the source code up to Azure DevOps through the command line tools.

1. Open the *Azure Cloud Shell* to the folder where the Student Files were unzipped (e.g. studentfiles). Then, navigate to the **tailspintoysweb** folder which contains the source code for our web application.

    > **Note**: If this folder doesn't exist ensure you followed the instructions in the 'Before the hands-on lab'.

    >**Note**: If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell you will be prompted for credentials when using Git. The best way to authenticate is to use a [personal access token](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate), PAT, with a scope Code, Full permissions. Then use that PAT as password (leave user name empty) when prompted.    

2. Open *Cloud Shell Editor* to this folder by typing: 
   
   ```bash
   code .
   ``` 

   Then press **Enter**. 
   
   >**Note**: Be sure to include the period after the code command as this instructs Code to open the current directory context.
   
3. In *Azure Cloud Shell*, initialize a local Git repository by running the following command:

    > If a ".git" folder and local repository already exists in the folder, then you will need to delete the ".git" folder first before running the commands below to initialize the Git repository.

    ```bash
    git init
    ```

4. Paste the first command you copied from Azure DevOps. It will resemble the command below:
    
    ```bash
    git remote add origin https://<your-org>@dev.azure.com/<your-org>/TailspinToys/_git/TailspinToys
    git push -u origin --all
    ```

5. In case the *Password for 'https://\<your-org>@dev.azure.com':* prompt appears, follow the next steps to generate a PAT (Personal Access Token) for your Azure DevOps organization. Otherwise, skip to step 13.
    
    > **Note**: These steps are also useful when using a multi-factored protected user account with Azure DevOps.
    
    > **Note**: **DO NOT CLOSE AZURE CLOUD SHELL**. Use a different tab for the steps for creating a new PAT token.

6. In *Azure DevOps*, choose on the second to last icon on the top menu in the left-hand side of the screen, representing a user and a small gear icon.

7. From the context menu, choose **Personal access tokens**.

    ![Selecting the player settings icon in the top menu bar](images/stepbystep/media/image132.png "Personal access tokens menu option")

8. If the *Create a new personal access token* dialog has appeared, skip to the next step. Otherwise, select the **+ New Token** button.

    ![Forcing the 'Create a new personal access token' to appear](images/stepbystep/media/image133.png "Personal access tokens menu option")

9. In the *Create a new personal access token* dialog, type in a descriptive name for the new token, and from the *Code* section, choose **Full** and **Status**.

    ![Creating a new PAT (Personal Access Token) in Azure Devops](images/stepbystep/media/image134.png "Personal access tokens menu option")

10. In the *Create a new personal access token* dialog, select the **Create** button.

11. From the success confirmation dialog, select the **Copy to clipboard** button to copy the newly created PAT token to clipboard.

    ![Copying the newly created PAT token to the clipboard](images/stepbystep/media/image135.png "Success confirmation page")

12. In *Azure Cloud Shell*, paste the PAT token and press **Enter**.

13. Type in the following commands to commit the changes made locally to the new repository:
    
    ```bash
    git add *
    git commit -m "adding files"
    ```

14. Push the changes up to the Azure DevOps repository with the following command:

    ```
    git push --set-upstream origin master
    ```

15. Navigate to the Repos > Files page which shows the files in the repository. You may need to refresh the page to see the updated files. Your source code is now appearing in Azure DevOps.

    ![The newly created files show up in Repos > Files section.](images/stepbystep/media/image136.png "Success confirmation page")

16. Expand the *ClientApp* directory. Choose the **package.json** file.

17. On line 27, change the value representing the version of the *rxjs* dependency, from *^6.0.0* to **6.0.0** (without the '^' character).

    ![The content of the package.json file is shown.](images/stepbystep/media/image138.png "Change rxjs dependency value to 6.0.0")

18. Next, hover the **package-lock.json** file and from the context menu, choose **Delete**.

    ![The context menu shows up on the package-lock.json file, from the ClientApp directory.](images/stepbystep/media/image137.png "Choose 'Delete'")

19. Confirm the deletion.

20. In the upper-right side of the page, choose **Commit**.

21. In the *Commit* dialog, validate the commit message and choose **Commit**.

## Exercise 3: Create Azure DevOps build pipeline

Duration: 15 Minutes

Implementing CI and CD pipelines helps to ensure a consistent, repeatable process is used to build, test, and release code.   This results in higher quality code that's readily available to users.

 **Azure DevOps Pipelines** provides an easy and extensible way to provide consistency when building and releasing your projects, while also making the configuration available to authorized users on your team.

Pipelines are made of one or more stages describing a CI/CD process. Stages are the major divisions in a pipeline: "build this app", "run these tests", and "deploy to pre-production" are good examples of stages.

Stages consist of one or more jobs, which are units of work assignable to a particular machine. Both stages and jobs may be arranged into dependency graphs: "run this stages before that one" or "this job depends on the output of that job".

Jobs consist of a linear series of steps. Steps can be tasks, scripts, or references to external YAML templates.

For Azure DevOps, this hierarchy is defined in the structure of a YAML (Yet Another Markup Language) file, which is a structured markup file that can be managed like any other source file.

This method enables a *Configuration As Code* scenario, declaratively defining the pipeline, and pipeline components such as stages, tasks, and conditions in detail.   Using YAML provides more visibility into pipeline structure and condition, and also provides integration and automation opportunities as well.

In Azure DevOps, YAML defines both "Build" or "Continuous Integration" pipelines as well as "Release" or "Continuous Delivery" pipelines in one shot, and this is what is meant by the term *"Unified Pipeline"*.    

In this lab, a sample pipeline YAML definition - *"sampleazure-pipelines.yml"* is included, representing a simple multi-stage pipeline with a custom trigger and a Pull Request Policy configuration.   In the following exercises and steps, you will be building a real-time equivalent of this file.  

While teams can use the Azure DevOps Pipeline visual designer to create multistage build and release pipelines to support a wide array of CI/CD scenarios, many teams prefer to define their build and release pipelines by editing the YAML configuration directly. 

A YAML build definition can be added to a project by including the YAML source file at the repository root. Azure DevOps will reference this configuration, evaluate it, and execute the configuraation during build runs.  

Azure DevOps also provides default templates within the editing workflow, for popular project types, integration points, and common tasks, and this works alongside a simple YAML designer to streamline the process of defining build and release tasks.

In this exercise, you will use the Azure DevOps Pipelines UI to create a build definition for the current project, but in subsequent steps, will be editing the YAML directly using the Unified YAML workflow.
  
### Task 1: Create a build pipeline
You will start with creating a basic build pipeline, tie it to the existing repository for to lay the groundwork for a basic CI scenario.   Then, you will expand the capability of the pipeline to include stages - transforming it into a multi-stage pipeline - representing basic CD characteristics wthin the same pipeline.  

build the web application with every commit of source code. This will lay the groundwork for us to then create a release pipeline for publishing the code to our Azure environments.


1. In your Azure DevOps project, select the **Pipelines** menu option from the left-hand navigation.

    ![In the Azure DevOps window, Pipelines is highlighted in the ribbon.](images/stepbystep/media/image68.png "Azure DevOps window")

2. Select the **Create pipeline** button to create a new build pipeline.

    ![In Builds, Create pipeline is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image69.png "Create a new pipeline")

3. This starts a wizard where you'll first need to select where your current code is located. In a previous step, you pushed code up to Azure Repos. Select the **Azure Repos Git** option.

    ![A screen that shows choosing the Azure Repos option for the TailspinToys project.](images/stepbystep/media/image70.png "Where is your code?")

4. Next, you'll need to select the specific repository where your code was pushed. In a previous step, you pushed it to the **TailspinToys** repository. Select the **TailspinToys** git repository.

    ![A screen that shows choosing the TailspinToys repository.](images/stepbystep/media/image71.png "Select a repository")

5. Then, you'll need to select the type of pipeline to configure. Although this pipeline contains a mix of technologies, select **ASP.NET Core** from the list of options.

    ![A screen that shows choosing ASP.NET Core pipeline.](images/stepbystep/media/image72.png "Configure your pipeline")

6. As a final step in the creation of a build pipeline, you are presented with a configured pipeline in the form of an azure-pipelines.yml file.   Azure DevOps has placed this file at the repository root and will reference the file as configuration during pipeliene runs.  
   
7. The YAML file contains a few lines of instructions (shown below) for the pipeline. Let's begin by updating the YAML with more specific instructions to build our application. 

    ![A screen that shows the starter pipeline YAML.](images/stepbystep/media/image72a.png "Review your pipeline YAML")

The *pool* section specifies which pool to use for a job of the pipeline. It also holds information about the job's strategy for running.

8. Select and replace the *pool* section with the following code:

    ```yml
    pool:
      vmImage: 'windows-latest'
      demands:
      - msbuild
      - visualstudio
      - vstest
    ```

    Steps are a linear sequence of operations that make up a job. Each step runs in its own process on an agent and has access to the pipeline workspace on disk. This means environment variables are not preserved between steps but, file system changes are.

9. Select and replace the *steps* section with the following code:
    
    ```yml
    steps:
    # Nuget Tool Installer Task
    - task: NuGetToolInstaller@0
      displayName: 'Use NuGet 4.4.1'
      inputs:
        versionSpec: 4.4.1      
    ```

    Tasks are the building blocks of a pipeline. They describe the actions that are performed in sequence during an execution of the pipeline.

10. Add additional tasks to your azure-pipelines.yml file by selecting and copying the following code. This should be pasted right after the NuGetToolInstaller@0 task which you pasted previously:
    
    >**Note**: The YAML below creates individual tasks for performing all the necessary steps to build and test our application along with publishing the artifacts inside Azure DevOps so they can be retrieved during the upcoming release pipeline process.

    ```yml
    # Nuget Restore Task
    - task: NuGetCommand@2
      displayName: 'NuGet restore'
      inputs:
        restoreSolution: '**/tailspintoysweb.csproj'

    # Node.js Tool Installer Task
    # Finds or downloads and caches the specified version spec of Node.js and adds it to the PATH
    - task: NodeTool@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '10.x' 

    # Build Task  
    - task: VSBuild@1
      displayName: 'Build solution'
      inputs:
        solution: '**/tailspintoysweb.csproj'
        msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\\"'
        platform: 'any cpu'
        configuration: 'release'

    # Publish Task
    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
      displayName: 'Publish Artifact'
      inputs:
        PathtoPublish: '$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)'
        ArtifactName: 'drop'
      condition: succeededOrFailed()
    ```

11. The final result should look like the following:

    ```yml
    trigger:
      - master

    pool:
      vmImage: 'windows-latest'
      demands:
      - msbuild
      - visualstudio
      - vstest

    steps:
    # Nuget Tool Installer Task
    - task: NuGetToolInstaller@0
      displayName: 'Use NuGet 4.4.1'
      inputs:
        versionSpec: 4.4.1

    # Node.js Tool Installer Task
    # Finds or downloads and caches the specified version spec of Node.js and adds it to the PATH
    - task: NodeTool@0
      inputs:
        versionSpec: '10.x' 
    
    # Nuget Restore Task
    - task: NuGetCommand@2
      displayName: 'NuGet restore'
      inputs:
        restoreSolution: '**/tailspintoysweb.csproj'

    # Build Task  
    - task: VSBuild@1
      displayName: 'Build solution'
      inputs:
        solution: '**/tailspintoysweb.csproj'
        msbuildArgs: '/p:DeployOnBuild=true /p:WebPublishMethod=Package /p:PackageAsSingleFile=true /p:SkipInvalidConfigurations=true /p:PackageLocation="$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\\"'
        platform: 'any cpu'
        configuration: 'release'

    # Publish Task
    - task: PublishBuildArtifacts@1
      displayName: 'Publish Artifact'
      inputs:
        PathtoPublish: '$(build.artifactstagingdirectory)'
        ArtifactName: 'drop'
      condition: succeededOrFailed()
    ```
    At this point you have defined a simple, single stage pipeline, that will perform the following tasks:
    - execute on change commits to the master branch
    - install key tools required to build
    - build
    - publish build artifacts to a known artifact location within Azure DevOps Pipelines.   

12. Choose the **Save and run** button to save our new pipeline and also kick off the first build.

    ![A screen showing the contents of the YAML editor. The Save and run button is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image73.png "Reivew your pipeline YAML")    

13. When the editor process saves your YAML, Azure DevOps Pipelines creates a new source file called *azure-pipelines.yml* to the root of your TailspinToys repository. This is done through a git commit that Azure DevOps facilitates as part of the save process which also prompts you to enter a commit message. 

    ![A screen that shows the commit of azure-pipelines.yml. The Save and run button is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image74.png "Save and run")
    
    By default, **Commit Message** will be populated for you but you may change this. Select the **Save and run** button at the bottom of the screen to commit the pipeline changes to your master branch.   

14. The build process will immediately begin and run through the steps defined in the azure-pipelines.yml file. Your Azure DevOps screen will refresh to show you the build process executing, in real-time. 

    ![A screen that shows the real-time output of the build process.](images/stepbystep/media/image76.png "Real-time output")   

15. After the build process completes, you should see a green check mark next to each of the build pipeline steps.
  
    ![A screen that shows a successfully completed build pipeline.](images/stepbystep/media/image77.png "Success") 
    
    **Congratulations!** You have just created your first build pipeline. In the next exercise, we will create a release pipeline that deploys your successful builds.

## Exercise 4: Create Azure DevOps Multi Stage Release Pipeline

Duration: 30 Minutes

In this exercise, you will modify the existing pipeline to include a basic release stage that performs the following tasks:
- automated deployment of build artifacts to Azure Pipeline storage. 
- deploy to the three stages created earlier (dev, test, and production)

### Task 1: Modify YAML definition to create a multistage pipeline

1. Now that we have a great build working, we can modify the YAML file to include stages.   At first, we will add one stage for Build and then run that so we can see the difference in output.   Navigate to the Pipeline definition and select Edit from the flyout menu:  

    ![A screen showing pipeline instance edit menu.](images/stepbystep/media/image1000.png "1000 review!") 

    This brings up the Azure Pipelines YAML Editor that you viewed before after building your initial pipeline: 

    ![A screen showing pipeline YAML Editor.](images/stepbystep/media/image1001.png "1001 review!") 
    
    On the left, is the YAML editor containing the pipeline definition and the Tasks Panel to the right, has common components that can be added to the pipeline.   
    
    Adding these components shows a property panel supporting enable custom configuration for your pipeline, allowing fast configuration.  The result is additional YAML is added to the pipeline definition with the configuration customization you provided. 

2. Let's transform this pipeline to a multi-stage configuration byt adding the following configuration right below the *trigger* section to define a **Build Stage** in your YAML pipeline. 

    ```yml
        stages:
        - stage: Build
            jobs:
            - job: Build
    ```
   This is the first step to a multi-stage pipeline!  
   
   You can define whatever stages you want to reflect the true nature of your CI/CD process, and as an added benefit, users get better visibility to entire pipeline process.  After adding this structure, your result should look like this:  

    ![A screen showing adding YAML stage code.](images/stepbystep/media/image1002.png "1002 review!")


3. Next, simply highlight the remainder of the YAML file that defines your build jobs and indent it four spaces (two tabs), thus making this definition a child of the build stage *jobs* node.   Your YAML should look like this now:

    ![A screen showing highlight of build code under stage definition.](images/stepbystep/media/image1003.png "1003 review!")

4. You now have a very simple multi-stage pipeline with a exactly one stage - a **Build Stage**.   
   
   Running the pipeline now would execute the pipeline as a single stage, and it would build exactly like it did before.   For now, be aware that using simple stage definitions like this means the stages execute in the order they are defined in the file.   More advanced pipeline definitions can support conditionals that govern stage execution.  

   Now, let's add a **Deployment Stage** by adding the YAML below to the bottom of the pipeline definition:


    ```yml
   - stage: Deploy
      jobs:
      - job: Deploy
        pool:
          name: Hosted VS2017
        steps:
    ```

    This is a simple definition for a Deployment Stage that by definition, will execute after the Build Stage because it is defined after the build stage. 
    
    Your YAML definition should now look like this:

    ![A screen showing simple Deploy Stage scaffolding.](images/stepbystep/media/image1004.png "1004 review!")

5. Now your pipeline definition file contains a build stage and a deploy stage.   For now, let's configure the deploy stage to deploy to the dev environment using deployment slots.   Then we can repeat this configuration to support test and production in a similar manner. perform the same action.  Set your cursor on a new line at the end of the YAML definition, and note that this will be the location where new tasks are added in the next step:

    ![A screen showing preferred cursor location to add tasks using the YAML Editor Taks Panel.](images/stepbystep/media/image1005.png "1005 review!")


6. Using the Tasks Panel, select the *Azure App Service Deploy* Task:  

    ![On the Pipeline Tasks Panel, Azure App Service Deploy Task is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1006.png "1006 review!")
    

    This will show a configuration panel to configure this deployment task with some fields containing default values:

    ![A screen showing the App Service Deploy Task configuration options.](images/stepbystep/media/image1007.png "1007 review!")

    Leave the **Connection type** as default, but in Azure Subscription, select the service connection you used earlier in the lab.   
    
    For **App Service type**, leave as default, and for **App Service name**, select the development appnamedropdown list, select **TailspinToys**.    
    
    Check **Deploy to Slot or App Service Environment**, and you should see additional configuration settings appear.   
    
    Set **Resource group** to the resource group you have been using, and select "Staging" for the **Slot**.   Leave all other fields as default, as we will configure those later.  

    At this point, the panel should look like this:

    ![On the Task Configuration, the image shows the Azure App Service deploy with reqwured values .](images/stepbystep/media/image1008.png "1008 review!")

    If the service connection is not authorized, you may be asked to authorize the service connection like this:

    ![In the Pipeline Task Configuration, the image shows Authorization dialog.](images/stepbystep/media/image1009.png "1009 review!")

    In this scenario, select Authorize to enable the integration with Azure DevOps. 
    
    Select **Add** to add this task as configured to your pipeline definition file, and on completion, you can see that the following YAML has been added in the YAML editor:

    ![In the Pipeline YAML editor, the image shows the YAML result from adding the Azure App Service deploy Task.](images/stepbystep/media/image1010.png "1010 review!")
    
7. At this point you now have a **Build Stage** that builds your project and publishes an artifact to a known location in Azure Pipelines.   You also have a **Deploy Stage** that will deploy the artifact to your dev environment, however, you need to make some additional adjustments to this stage to tie everything together. 

    Looking at the last taks of your build stage you can see that the publish task places the build artifacts in a specific location: 

    ![In the code editor, the Publish Build Artifacts Tasks definition is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1011.png "1011 review!")

    Your deploy stage needs to download the artifacts from the Build Stage published location in order to install them in the dev environment, and Azure Pipeliness has a task template for that.   
    
    Place your cursor at this position in your YAML editor:

    ![Screen showing preferred cursor position in the YAML Editor.](images/stepbystep/media/image1012.png "1012 review!")
    
    Search Tasks for *"download build"* and select the **Download Build Artifacts** task.   
    
    ![Screen showing YAML Editor Task Panel Search for download build.  The Download Build Artifacts Template and Add button are highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1013.png "1013 review!")
    
    As before, a configuration panel is shown so you can configure the task before adding.   
    
    ![Screen showing close up of the Download Build Artifacts template with Add button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1014.png "1014 review!")
    
    In **Destination Directory** add the default path used by your publish task in the build stage and select **Add**.   
    
    This will add the task as configured to your YAML.  As an alternative, you can select tasks and add them, and then edit their properties directly in the YAML editor.  
    
    Finally, be sure to check task indenting:

    ![Screen showing YAML code highlighted for indent check in YAML Editor.](images/stepbystep/media/image1015.png "1015 review!")
    
    
8.  The task you just added needs one additional property added in order to be able to execute properly.  Let's modify the taks by editing the YAML directly.  In the editor, add a property **artifactName* to the **DownloadBuildArtifact** task you just added, and set the value to *"drop"*:

    ![Screen showing YAML code highlighted on artifactName property for value edit in the YAML Editor.](images/stepbystep/media/image1016.png "1016 review!")

    
9.  At this point, the deployment stage can find and download the build artifacts during exection. Reivew your YAML file for proper indentation and then select **Save** to commit changes to the pipeline.  

    ![Screen showing highlighted Save button on the pipeline YAML Editor.](images/stepbystep/media/image1017.png "1017 review!")

10. Azure DevOps will prompt for the commit message and the commit goes directly to the master branch: 

    ![Screen showing a commit dialog with Save button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1018.png "1018 review!")
    
11. Since this changes the master branch, and your pipeline is configured to trigger on master, the pipeline will immediately run.   Using the left menu, navigate to **Pipelines** select the new build:

    ![Screen showing left navigation options with Pipelines highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1019.png "1019 review!")
    
    From here you can see the multiple stages you've just added in the **Stages** column.  
    
    ![Screen showing recent pipeline run from the previous commit task with the Runs tab, build name and the Tasks item is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1020.png "1020 review!")


12. When the **Build** stage completes, select the **Deploy** stage to follow each task:

    ![Screen showing the Build and Deploy Stage recently added.](images/stepbystep/media/image1021.png "1021 review!")

    Expand the **AzureRmWebAppDeployment** task to review the steps performed during the Azure deployment. Once the task completes, your app is live on Azure.

    ![Screen showing stage execution log view with AzureRmWebAppDeployment highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1022.png "1022 review!")

    
13. **Congratulations!** You have just created your first multistage pipeline!  Now, let's verify your deployment.   Using **Azure Portal**, navigate to the resource group you created earlier to view your app services in this resource group .   Sort by **Type** Select the development app service:

    ![Screen showing Azure Portal provisioned assets in lab resource group , the dev Web App Service and sorted type column header are highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1023.png "1023 review!")

    On the App Service Overview, select **Browse**:
    ![Screen showing Azure Portal detail view of provisioned development web app service with Browse highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1024.png "1024 review!")

    This will launch your default browser navigating to your development site:

    ![Screen showing Edge browser showing development application.](images/stepbystep/media/image1025.png "1025 review!")

    A successful deployment!   In the next task we will add stages for deploying to Test and Production.   Once you deploy, you can use the this step to verify those sites too. 

### Task 2: Add Test and Production Environments as stages in the pipeline

You could repeat the process in **Task 1** to add stages for Test and Production by using the Tasks panel.  However, the beauty of the unified YAML pipeline definition is the speed at which you can "copy-paste" the Development Deploy Stage within the YAML editor, and then just change the particular values for your Test and Production environments.   Let's add a Test deployment stage now. 

    
1. Return to Azure DevOps Pipeline view and select your new multistage pipeline and select **Edit** for the YAML editor.   

    Scroll down to the Development Deploy Stage and highlight and copy the script for that entire stage:

    ![Screen showing YAML Editor and Development Deployment Stage is highlighted for copy-paste operation.](images/stepbystep/media/image1026.png "1026 review!")

2. Move your cursor to the very end of the YAML definition file and paste the copied development environment deployment stage code.  Now you can look though the newly pasted stage and change certain properties to match your Test environment.  Begin by changing the **stage:** string name property to *TestDeploy* and then, change the **DisplayName** property to *Test Deploy Stage*. 

3. Move to the nested Deployment Task, and change **WebAppName** to match the Web App Name for your test environment, in this case *tailspintoys-test-\<randomstring>* 

4. Leave every other property the same.   Your YAML should now look like this: 

    ![Screen showing YAML Editor with added Test Deployment Stage.](images/stepbystep/media/image1027.png "1027 review!")

    Select **Save**.   
    
    ![Screen showing Commit dialog with.](images/stepbystep/media/image1028.png "1028 review!")

    As before, add your commit message, and select **Save**.   This will save the YAML definition file contents, commit to the master branch and which will trigger a pipeline run.

5. Let's go take a look at the pipeline run. Navigate to Pipeline view to view recently run pipelines.   You can see the run triggered from your commited change here.   
    
    ![Screen showing Pipeline run with run details highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1029.png "1029 review!")

    Select this newest run and let's dig deeper.

    ![Screen showing pipeline run details with multiple stages now added.](images/stepbystep/media/image1030.png "1030 review!")

    In this view, you can see that your multistage pipeline now has 3 stages:  Build, Dev, Test.   Selecting Test Deploy Stage shows you the Jobs detail view with access to all the tasks that executed.   Note that on the **AzureRmWebAppDeployment** task, you can see navigable links for deployment history and the application URL:

    ![Screen showing Pipeline Job Detail View with AzureRmWebAppDeployment task selected.  Hightlighted are the deployment log and app URL.](images/stepbystep/media/image1031.png "1031 review!")

6. At this point you have configured a working multistage pipeline that builds, publishes and deploy to two of your provisioned environments (Dev and Test).   Repeat the steps 1-5 above, to add a Test deployment stage to create a **Production Deployment Stage**.  Take careful note of the properties you changed above to edit them for the production environment, and save the pipeline configuration.

7. If your configuration was successfull, this should have triggered a pipeline run that looks like this:

    ![Screen showing Pipeline run.](images/stepbystep/media/image1032.png "1032 review!")

Congratulations! You have completed the creation of a release pipeline with four stages.

## Exercise 5: Trigger a build and release

Duration: 10 Minutes

In this exercise, you will trigger an automated build and release of the web application using the build and release pipelines you created in earlier exercises. The release pipeline will deploy to three stages: dev, test, and production.

Any commit to the master branch will automatically trigger a build, but you can man manually trigger, or queue a build without a code change.

### Task 1: Manually queue a new build and follow it through the release pipeline

1. To manually queue a build, select **Pipelines** from left navigation and choose your *TailspinToys* pipeline to view recent runs and select the  **Run pipeline** button in the upper right corner to queue the build:

    ![Screen showing pipeline runs with Run Pipeline button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1033.png "1033 review!")


2. This action presents a modal window titled **Run pipeline**. Choose the **Run** button at the bottom of the modal window to queue a manual build. 

    ![Screen showing Run Pipeline panel with Run button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1034.png "1034 review!")


3. Because you configured continuous deployment using the Unified YAML approach you get a full execution from dev, through test, to production. Let's verify the run by selecting the manual run and viewing the details:

    ![On the screen, the manual run has successfully completed. Each stage has a green checkmark.](images/stepbystep/media/image1035.png "1035 review!")


## Exercise 6: Setup a pull request policy, create a task branch and submit a pull request

Duration: 30 Minutes

In this exercise, you will first set up a pull request policy for the master branch, then create a short-lived task branch.  In this branch you will make a small code change, commit, push the code, and finally, submit a pull request. 

Then, you will merge the pull request into the master branch, triggering an automated build and release of your application.  For this exercise, you will use Azure DevOps workflow to complete the tasks, but keep in mind this same procss could be performed locally using the Azure Command Line Interface (CLI), or an IDE of your choice.

### Task 1: Set up a pull request policy

1.  On left navigation, select **Repos** and select **Branches** to view branches associated with your repo.  For now there is only the master branch.   Select the ellipsis for the master branch and select **Branch policies**.

    ![Screen showing the Azure DevOps Branches screen indicating the selection of the Branches link on the far left, followed by selecting the ellipsis next to the master branch and choosing branch policies from the menu.](images/stepbystep/media/image1036.png "1036 review")


2.  Enable the policy by checking **Check for linked work items** (1) and **Check for comment resolution** (2)

    ![Screen showing the branch policies for master screen with Check for linked work items and check for comment resolution checked and the add button for branch policy highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1037.png "1037 review!")
    
    Lets unpack what these configurations do:

    The first check, *Check for linked work items* enables the build policy to require a work item to be included with a pull request.  The work item may be added with one of the commits, or added directly to the pull request.

    >**Note**: It is recommended to enable this setting.  If you *do* enable this then you also must add a work item in your process below with the code changes in this task set.  You can ignore this setting for the workshop if you don't want to add a work item.

    The second check. *Check for comment resolution* ensures comments applied to this pull request during the peer review phase require resolution.

3.  Now select **+** (3) to add the build policy.  This will enable the build to run when a pull request is created.  In the *Add build policy* dialog, choose the correct **Build pipeline** and add a **Display name** and select **Save**.   

    ![Screen showing the Add Build Policy panel with the Build pipeline and Display Name values added, and Display Name and Save button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1038.png "1038 review!")

    You should see your new configured branch policy right below the Branch Policies section like this:

    ![Screen showing build validation detail.](images/stepbystep/media/image1039.png "1039 review!")

### Task 2: Create a new branch

1. From left navigation **Repos**, choose **Branches** to show the Branches view.  Select **New branch** in the upper right corner to create a new branch from master: 

    ![Screen showing configured branches with New branch button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1040.png "1040 review!")

2. In the **Create a branch** dialog, enter a name for the new branch (e.g. **new-heading**). In the *Based on* field, be sure **master** is selected.

    ![Screen showing, Name and Base highlighted along with the Create button.](images/stepbystep/media/image107.png "107 review!")

3. Select the **Create** button.

### Task 3: Make a code change to the task branch

1.  From the **Branches** view, select your newly created branch, this will navigate to a *Files* view showing all  files for this branch.

    ![Screen showing configured branches with the new-heading branch highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1041.png "1041 review!")

2. You will use this view to make a change to a source file from the web application we have been deploying to your 3 environments in earlier steps.  

    ![Screen showing Azure DevOps Branch source explorer with file detail view.](images/stepbystep/media/image1042.png "1042 review!")
    
    Under the *tailspintoysweb* folder, select the **ClientApp** folder, and expand and select the **src** folder.  

3. Next expand the **app** folder then expand the **home** folder.  In this folder, select the **home.component.html** file.  The editor to the right displays the contents of this file.   Now, select **Edit** button on the top right of the screen to begin editing the page.

    ![Screen showing Azure DevOps Branch source explorer with target file highlighted and code editor view enabled.](images/stepbystep/media/image1043.png "1043 review!")
    
4. Replace the text ```<h1>Welcome to Tailspin Toys v1!</h1>``` on *line 1* with the following:

    ```
    <h1>Welcome to Tailspin Toys v2!</h1>
    ```
    
5.  Now that you've completed the code change, select the **Commit** button on the top right side of the screen.

    ![Screen showing editor with line 6 code change and Commit button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image110.png "Completing the code change")

    This will present the Commit dialog where you can enter a comment; one will automatically be filled in for you. Select the **Commit** button.

    ![On the popup, the Commit button is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image111.png "Commit dialog popup")

### Task 4: Submit a pull request

1. Locate and select the **Create a pull request** button.

    ![On the screen, Create a pull request is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image112.png "Create a pull request")

2. This brings up the *New Pull Request* page. It shows we are submitting a request to merge code from our **new-heading** branch into the **master** branch. You have the option to change the *Title* and *Description* fields. 
    
    For the **Reviewers** field, type **Tailspin** and select **[TailspinToys]\TailspinToys Team** from the search results to assign a review to the TailspinToys Team (which you are a member of).  
    
    A member of this team must review the pull request before it can be merged and the details details for the code change are included in the middle of the view.

    ![On the screen, New pull request dialog is shown with create button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1044.png "1044 review!")

3. Select the **Create** to submit the pull request.

### Task 5: Approve and complete a pull request

Typically, the next few steps would be performed by another team member, allowing the code to be peer reviewed. 

However, in this scenario, you will continue as if you are the only developer on the project.  

1.  After submitting the pull request, you are presented with Pull Request review screen. Let's assume all the changes made were acceptable to the review team.  Submitting the pull request results in this view:

    ![Screen showing the updated wull request detail with the Approval button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1045.png "1045 review!")

    There is a lot of functionality here, but for the purpose of this lab, let's focus on this pull request approval by confirming that the  build is green. 

    >**Note**: If the build is not green, you cannot merge the Pull Request as in step 2-4 below. You are then blocked. If you chose the **Check for linked work items** policy in task 1, you will be blocked until you create and attach a work item to your pull request. You can create a new work item by selecting **Boards** and then **Work items**. Then navigate back here and you can choose the new work item from the dropdown on the right side of the page.

2. Next, select the **Approve** button to approve of the code that was modified submitted as part of the pull request.  Here you can see all required checks succeeded and there are no merge conflicts.  Everything necessary is green! 

   The section below the **Description** notes you approved the pull request and now you can select **Complete** to merge the code from the pull request into the master branch.

    ![Screen showing the updated wull request detail with the Complete button highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1046.png "1046 review!")

3.  On selecting **Complete** in the previous step, a **Complete pull request** dialog shows. Here you can add additional comments for the merge activity. 

    ![Screen showing the Complete pull request dialog box with Complete associated work items after merging and Delete new-heading after merging checked.  Customize merge commit message is unchecked.  Complete merge button is highlighted.](images/stepbystep/media/image1047.png "1047 review!")

    By selecting the **Delete new-heading after merging** option, our branch will be deleted after the merge has been completed and this feature keeps your repository clean of old branches help to eliminate the possibility of confusion.

4.  Select the **Complete merge** button.  You will then see a confirmation view of the completed pull request.  
    ![Screen showing the confirmation view of the complete pull request.](images/stepbystep/media/image1048.png "1048 review!")



5.  **Congratulations!** By following the tasks in these exercises, you created a new branch and changed some code in the new branch, submitted a pull request and approved the pull request which resulted in a code merge to the master branch.  

    Because you configured continuous deployment using Azure DevOps Pipelines, an automated build was triggered:

    ![Screen showing recent pipeline runs.   The most recent is related to completion of the pull request.](images/stepbystep/media/image1049.png "1049 review!")

    And deployment to all stages executed immediately after the successful build:

    ![Screen showing most recent pipeline run detail including each of the properly configured stages.](images/stepbystep/media/image1050.png "1050 review!")

    All stages green!   Nice job!

## After the hands-on lab

Duration: 10 Minutes

### Task 1: Delete resources

1.  Now since the hands-on lab is complete, go ahead and delete the resource group you created for the Tailspin Toys deployments along with the Azure DevOps project that were created for this hands-on lab. You will no longer need those resources and it will be beneficial to clean up your Azure Subscription.

These steps should be followed only *after* completing the hands-on lab.
