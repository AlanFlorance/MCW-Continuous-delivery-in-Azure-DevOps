# Continuous delivery in Azure DevOps before the hands-on lab setup guide

## Requirements

1.  Microsoft Azure subscription

2.  Local machine or a virtual machine configured with:

    -   Visual Studio Code

    -   Git command-line interface (CLI)

## Before the hands-on lab

Duration: 30 minutes

In this lab, you will create a developer environment and download the required files for this course if you do not already have one that meets the requirements.

### Prerequisites

-   Microsoft Azure subscription <http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/>

-   Client computer with Windows 7 or later with Visual Studio Code and Git installed

>NOTE: If you meet both of the above requirements, skip to Task 2 below.

### Task 1: Use Azure Shell as your development environment

>NOTE: This task is for students that do not have a client computer with Visual Studio Code and Git installed or would rather not put lab files on a personal device. This workshop can be completed using only the Azure Cloud Shell. Perform the steps below if you are limited to using the Azure Cloud Shell. If you do have a client computer with Visual Studio code and Git installed, skip to the next task.

1.  From the Azure web portal, launch the **Azure Cloud Shell**. It has common Azure tools preinstalled and configured to use with your account.

2.  From inside the Azure Cloud Shell type these commands to configure Git:

    ```
    git config --global user.name "<your name>"
    git config --global user.email <your email>
    ```

### Task 2: Download the exercise files

1.  Download the exercise files for the training. Start by creating a new folder to place the files.

2.  Download the support files (.zip format), https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/agile-continous-delivery/studentfiles.zip to the new folder. If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can download the file by executing the following command inside the Cloud Shell window (all on one line):

    ```
    curl -o studentfiles.zip https://cloudworkshop.blob.core.windows.net/agile-continous-delivery/studentfiles.zip
    ```

3.  Extract the contents of the file to the new folder. If you are using the Azure Cloud Shell, you can execute the following command inside the Cloud Shell window:

    ```bash
    unzip studentfiles.zip
    ```

4. When unzipped, there will be two new folders named **arm** and **tailspintoysweb**. The workshop will refer to these folders throughout the exercises.
